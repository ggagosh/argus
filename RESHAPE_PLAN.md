# Reshape Plan for MongoDB Slow Query Analyzer

This document outlines the plan for reshaping the existing MongoDB Slow Query Analyzer application to match the detailed UX requirements.

## Current Application Structure

The application currently has:
- Next.js framework with React 19
- File upload functionality
- Dashboard with summary metrics
- Multiple tabs for different views (Overview, Collections, QueryPatterns, etc.)
- Visualization components using Recharts

## Changes Needed

### 1. Upload & Import Page

**Current Implementation:**
- Upload functionality exists within the main page
- Sample data loading option is available

**Required Changes:**
- Create a dedicated Upload page with clear instructions
- Enhance the UI for drag-and-drop and file selection
- Add better validation and feedback for uploaded files
- Improve the success confirmation and transition to analysis

### 2. Dashboard (Slow Query Overview)

**Current Implementation:**
- Overview tab with basic metrics
- Charts for query distribution

**Required Changes:**
- Enhance the summary metrics section with more KPIs
- Implement more comprehensive filter and time range controls
- Improve the slow queries table with better sorting and highlighting
- Add more interactive elements for drill-down navigation

### 3. Query Details & Analysis Page

**Current Implementation:**
- Basic query details view
- Limited visualization of query performance

**Required Changes:**
- Create a dedicated Query Details page
- Implement execution stats list for each query occurrence
- Add more performance charts (duration over time, keys examined vs docs returned)
- Enhance the display of index usage and query plan
- Implement AI-powered suggestions section

### 4. UI Components

**Current Implementation:**
- Basic table and chart components
- Limited filtering capabilities

**Required Changes:**
- Enhance the Table component with better sorting, filtering, and highlighting
- Improve Chart components for better visualization of query performance
- Create a new AI Suggestions panel component
- Implement better navigation between dashboard and detail views

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhance Upload Experience

- Improve validation and parsing of MongoDB log files
- Add clearer transition from upload to analysis

### Phase 2: Improve Dashboard
- Enhance summary metrics with more relevant KPIs
- Implement comprehensive filtering and sorting options
- Improve the slow queries table with better highlighting and interaction

### Phase 3: Create Query Details Page
- Implement a dedicated page for query details
- Add execution stats list and performance charts
- Enhance index usage and query plan visualization

### Phase 4: Implement AI Suggestions
- Create the AI-powered suggestions panel
- Integrate suggestion generation with query analysis
- Implement user interaction with suggestions

### Phase 5: Improve Navigation and Overall UX
- Enhance navigation between pages
- Implement responsive design for all components
- Add workflow guidance for first-time users

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Use existing Next.js and React structure
- Leverage ShadCN UI components for consistent design
- Utilize Recharts for enhanced data visualization
- Implement AI integration for query analysis and suggestions
- Ensure responsive design for all components
